# Netflix Data Analysis Project Using SQL

## Overview
This analysis explores Netflixâ€™s content strategy, focusing on content distribution, genre and rating preferences, and regional trends for Movies and TV Shows. Independently crafted questions guide the project to uncover audience trends, regional preferences, and insights for optimizing engagement and content reach.

## Objective
Goal is to provide insights on optimizing content release strategies and improving audience engagement across different countries.

## Dataset

Dataset is collected from Kaggle:

- **Dataset Link:** [Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/octopusteam/full-netflix-dataset)

## Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE netflix_data
(
	show_id	VARCHAR(10)PRIMARY KEY,
	type VARCHAR(7),
	title VARCHAR(150),
	director VARCHAR(250),
	casts VARCHAR(800),
	country	VARCHAR(150),
	date_added	VARCHAR(20),
	release_year INT,
	rating	VARCHAR(10),
	duration VARCHAR(10),

);
```

## Data Cleaning

```sql
SELECT show_id, COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY show_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>1; -- No Duplicate Rows are Present


-- Checking For Null Values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE show_id IS NULL OR show_id=''; -- show_id has no null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE type IS NULL OR type='';       -- type has no null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE title IS NULL OR title='';     -- title has no null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE director IS NULL OR director=''; -- Director have null Values(2634)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE casts IS NULL OR casts='';       --  Casts have null values(825)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE country IS NULL OR country='';  --  Country have null values(831)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE date_added IS NULL OR date_added='';  -- Date_added have null values(10)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE release_year IS NULL;               -- Release year have no null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE rating IS NULL OR rating='';       -- rating have null value(4)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE duration IS NULL OR duration='';  -- duration have null value(3)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE listed_in IS NULL OR listed_in='';  -- listed_in have no null values

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_data
WHERE description IS NULL OR description=''; -- description has no null values


-- Replacing Director, Cast, Country with Unknown and rest is keep as null(null % below 5) --

UPDATE netflix_data
SET director = CASE WHEN director IS NULL THEN 'Unknown' ELSE director END,
casts = CASE WHEN casts IS NULL THEN 'Unknown' ELSE casts END,
country = CASE WHEN country IS NULL THEN 'Unknown' ELSE country END;


-- Wrong Value changed from column rating --

SELECT COUNT(rating) FROM netflix_data
WHERE rating LIKE '%min%';

UPDATE netflix_data                 
SET rating= CASE WHEN rating LIKE '%min%' THEN NULL ELSE rating END;


-- Formatting Date Column --

UPDATE netflix_data
SET date_added = TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY'), 'YYYY-MM-DD');

UPDATE netflix_data
SET date_added = TO_DATE(date_added,'YYYY-MM-DD');


-- Inserted a new column with value year from date_added --

ALTER TABLE netflix_data
ADD COLUMN date_added_year INT;

UPDATE netflix_data
SET date_added_year= CAST(LEFT(date_added, 4) AS INT);

SELECT date_added,date_added_year FROM netflix_data;
```

## Analysis

### 1. What is the current distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows in Netflix's catalog?

```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) Total_Content FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY type;
```

### 2. Which ratings are most common for Movies and TV Shows, and do certain ratings dominate specific content types?

```sql
WITH content_rating AS (
SELECT type,rating, COUNT(*) Total_Count
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY type,rating
ORDER BY Total_Count DESC)

SELECT r.type, r.rating, r.total_count FROM (
SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY Total_Count DESC) AS ranking
    FROM content_rating
) r
WHERE ranking=1;
```

### 3. Which years saw the highest volume of content added, and how does this break down between Movies and TV Shows?

```sql
-- For Movies
SELECT date_added_year, COUNT(*)Total_Content FROM netflix_data
WHERE type ='Movie'
GROUP BY date_added_year
ORDER BY Total_Content DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- For TV Shows
SELECT date_added_year, COUNT(*)Total_Content FROM netflix_data
WHERE type ='TV Show'
GROUP BY date_added_year
ORDER BY Total_Content DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Is there a trend in Netflix adding "fresh" Movies & TV Show those released within the same year as their original release date?

```sql
WITH release_year AS (
SELECT date_added_year,

COUNT(CASE WHEN type='Movie' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) Total_Movies,
COUNT(CASE WHEN type='TV Show' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) Total_TV_Show
FROM netflix_data
GROUP BY date_added_year
ORDER BY Movies DESC
LIMIT 6)

SELECT date_added_year, Movies,
ROUND((Movies::numeric/Total_Movies)*100,2) Achievement_percentage_of_movies,
TV_Shows,
ROUND((TV_Shows::numeric/Total_TV_Show)*100,2) Achievement_percentage_of_tv_shows

COUNT(CASE WHEN type='Movie' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) Total_movie_content,
COUNT(CASE WHEN type='TV Show' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) Total_tvshow_content
FROM content_across_countries
GROUP BY TRIM(available_country)
ORDER BY Total_movie_content DESC;
```

content_across_countries_with_rating as (
SELECT TRIM(available_country) Country, rating, COUNT(*) Total_Content
FROM content_across_country
WHERE available_country <>''
GROUP BY TRIM(available_country), rating
ORDER BY TRIM(available_country))

SELECT r.country, r.rating, r.total_content FROM 
 (SELECT * ,
 RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_content DESC) ranking
 FROM content_across_countries_with_rating)r

```

### 11. Do audiences show specific intrest in genre preferences, and are there particular rating preferences within those genres?
